How to force fsck to check filesystem after system reboot on Linux when using systemd
The procedure is as follows:
1. Edit the /etc/default/grub file on Debian/Ubuntu. CentOS/RHEL/Fedora/Rocky/Alma Linux user edit the /etc/sysconfig/grub file.
2. Find line that read as GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and append the fsck.mode=force. You may have other config options. Just add it between the quote marks. For example:â€¨GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet fsck.mode=force". To force all auto repair option including that may cause damage add the fsck.repair=yes option too.
3. Then run an sudo update-grub
4. Reboot the Linux system by tying the sudo reboot
5. After that system will boot. The system will run fsck on ext4 file systems.
6. Finally, when you get a shell prompt, make sure you remove the fsck.mode=force config option from the /etc/default/grub file and run the update-grub command again.

Or

sudo touch /forcefsck
And reboot
